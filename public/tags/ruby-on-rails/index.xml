      <description>Ooo wee. It&amp;rsquo;s been almost a month since Top Setup was created! I&amp;rsquo;ve done quite a bit of development since then. It&amp;rsquo;s starting to look pretty sharp.
Have a look at some of these fancy pictures ðŸ˜¬
I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a bit more about Rails too. The rails g scaffold feature was really helpful in getting the website up and running quickly. However, I&amp;rsquo;m beginning to have reservations about using scaffolds. My reason is that it does way too much for you.</description>

      <description>I am finally done with the design phase of TopSetupâ„¢! Time to start coding! ðŸ¤—
I just started learning Ruby on Rails about a month ago to prepare for my new internship at Brand New Box. Iâ€™ve used AngularJS which is another MVC framework, but it was JavaScript based. Easy stuff. Rails, on the other hand, is completely new territory since it is Ruby based.
I canâ€™t believe I waited this long to learn it.</description>

      <title>TopSetup: UI/UX Designing</title>

      <description>As a developer, the only thing Iâ€™ve ever considered when it comes to user experience is performance. Is my app laggy? Is my website slow? My worries usually end there.
But, UX design is so much more than that. There are certain rules of thumb I never thought Iâ€™d have to think about. For example, did you know labels should be placed ABOVE a form field? You donâ€™t want your users to move their eyes too much.</description>

      <description>Hey peeps. This is the start of my coding related blog! Iâ€™ve been wanting to start this but never really found a good opportunity.
Until now! ðŸ¤—
As part of my internship training, I was tasked to come up with a project idea and build it from scratch! Front-end to back-end. Ruby on Rails. I had a few different ideas but this one is the most relevant to my current hobbies.</description>
