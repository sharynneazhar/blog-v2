      <description>The first project in my parallel programming class is to implement a train scheduling system using threads (we will be coding this in C++). You can find more information about the project in my previous post.
Up to this point, I&amp;rsquo;ve only dealt with sequential programming which means instructions are executed one at a time. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to visualize programs like that. Without running the program, you can easily trace through your code and know if something will be off.</description>

      <description>This semester, Iâ€™m taking a class on parallel programming - EECS 690: Multicore and GPGPU Programming.
It&amp;rsquo;s a funny story actually. I meant to take the Computer Graphics (EECS 672) class, but it was only offered in the fall. Then, I saw this 690 class that is taught by the same professor. I had no idea what multicore meant but I know GPU. It had to have something to do with graphics, right?</description>
