      <description>A little over a year ago, I was a relatively new developer. I was really enthusiastic and passionate about improving my coding skills, especially in the areas of web and mobile development. Even though I was in school for Computer Science, the curriculum doesn&amp;rsquo;t exactly teach you how to develop real life applications. All we learn about are data structures and algorithms. LOTS OF THEM.
I was 100% sure that I will not go to graduate school (at least, not in the next few years), and as much as I enjoyed learning about data structures, I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I was well-prepared for a job.</description>
