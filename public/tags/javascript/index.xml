      <description>We all can agree that JavaScript can be a huge pain sometimes (ok, maybe all the time). It&amp;rsquo;s constantly changing and there are a lot of nuances with its methods. A couple years ago, I was introduced to ES6 and all of its awesome new features, particularly its new iterative methods like some(), filter(), indexOf() and a few others. Learning these methods made my JavaScript life a little bit sweeter.</description>

      <description>I first learned about the JSON.stringify() method from a senior developer during an internship. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve used it A LOT to debug JS code, but one thing that always annoyed me was how it prints the whole JSON object in one long line.
I spent a good 30 minutes or so looking at different Stack Overflow solutions. Through combinations of googling bad keywords and lazy skimming, I found a good great solution.</description>
