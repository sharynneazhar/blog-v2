      <description>For a current project I&amp;rsquo;m working on, I had the task to create a generic table view. There were a few caveats. The website will be used in schools so that means a lot of Internet Explorer users&amp;hellip; possibly old versions of IE as well.
Well, that stinks.
My first instinct is to use Bootstrap&amp;rsquo;s table component. Bootstrap already has responsive class all set up and ready to go, so why not?</description>
