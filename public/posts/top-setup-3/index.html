<p>I just started learning Ruby on Rails about a month ago to prepare for my new internship at <a href="http://brandnewbox.com/">Brand New Box</a>. I‚Äôve used AngularJS which is another MVC framework, but it was JavaScript based. Easy stuff. Rails, on the other hand, is completely new territory since it is Ruby based.</p>

<p>I can‚Äôt believe I waited this long to learn it. Rails is a lazy programmer‚Äôs dream!</p>

<p>There is quite a bit of a learning curve, but once you get over that hump, you‚Äôll find that it does a lot of the heavy work for you. Here are a couple things so far that I found amazingly helpful:</p>

<p>Generators
Rails has a set of <code>rails generate</code> commands that work on the terminal. They generate a lot of code for you so that you don‚Äôt have to go through the tedious task of creating and organizing the files yourself. For example, if you need to create a view for a blog post:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ rails generate scaffold BlogPost title:string content:text
</code></pre>

<p>This will not only create the views, but it will also create the model, controller, assets, tests, and routes you might need. Plus, if you think you‚Äôve made a mistake and want to start over, you can just run <code>rails destroy</code>. It will remove all the related files for you.</p>

<p>Migrations
One of the things I always hate doing is changing a database schema after it‚Äôs already been created. Rails is the bomb dot com with migrations. They are automatically timestamped and versioned. Oh, you‚Äôve created a BlogPosts model and realized your silly tush forgot to include a column for the blog content? No worries. Just run:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ rails generate migration add_content_to_blogPosts content:text
$ rake db:migrate
</code></pre>

<p>Boom! Done.</p>
