      <p>We all can agree that JavaScript can be a huge pain sometimes (ok, maybe all the time). It&rsquo;s constantly changing and there are a lot of nuances with its methods. A couple years ago, I was introduced to <a href="https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features">ES6</a> and all of its awesome new features, particularly its new iterative methods like <code>some()</code>, <code>filter()</code>, <code>indexOf()</code> and a few others. Learning these methods made my JavaScript life a little bit sweeter.</p>

<p>I had the honor of refactoring some legacy code recently for a popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOC</a> company. The task was to determine if a student had graduated from a degree program and if the program was eligible for certain employment opportunities. To do that, I&rsquo;d have to iterate over a couple different lists: the student&rsquo;s list degree enrollments and the list of eligible degrees.</p>

<p>There are many ways to approach this, but my first instinct was to do:</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">function isEligible(studentList, eligibleList) {
  var isEligible = false;
  for (var i = 0; i &lt; studentList.length; i++) {
    for (var j = 0; j &lt; eligibleList.length; j++) {
      if (studentList[i].graduated &amp;&amp; studentList[i] === eligibleList[j])
        isEligible = true;
    }
  }

  return isEligible;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if we could smash all that into one single line?</p>

<p>The <code>some()</code> method does exactly that. Here, I paired the <code>some()</code> method and the <code>indexOf()</code> method to get:</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">let isEligible = studentList.some(degree =&gt; eligibleList.indexOf(degree) !== -1);
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>indexOf()</code> method searches the eligibleList array for the specified degree and return its position, or <code>-1</code> if not found. If at least one of the degrees was found in eligibleList, then <code>some()</code> returns true.</p>

<p>In terms of performance, native (vanilla) JS would almost always win. The question boils down to &ldquo;Do you want to spend time code more than you have to or leverage what&rsquo;s already out there?&rdquo; For me, I&rsquo;m willing to sacrifice a little bit of performance to save time and to have cleaner code.</p>

<p><em>Edit: The new iterative methods mentioned above was introduced earlier in <a href="http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.4.4.17">ES5 specifications</a>.</em></p>
