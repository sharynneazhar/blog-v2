      <p>Oh my goodness. It is officially my last week as a Cerner intern. *<em>sad face</em>*</p>

<p>When I began the internship, I had a pretty good idea of what to expect, especially since half of my friends work for Cerner. The internship is going to start off slow with orientation and a few tours. Then, I&rsquo;ll be thrown right into a project and I&rsquo;ll learn how to be big girl developer. Pretty chill.</p>

<p>It has been a little over two months now and I have learned so much about software engineering, the important role Cerner plays in healthcare IT, and what it takes to excel in this industry. I am glad to say that my internship with Cerner has been more meaningful than my expectations. Here are a few of my favorite takeaways and moments:</p>

<p><strong>Favorite Takeaways</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The people around you are there in your best interest.</strong> Even though I already had friends at Cerner, starting a job at a new place can prove to be difficult, especially if you&rsquo;re extremely timid like me. You&rsquo;re a new face and there is already an established culture. I felt pressured to fit in, but to my surprise, it wasn&rsquo;t like that at all. From day one, <em>I didn&rsquo;t expect</em> to feel so welcomed. As people walked by my desk, they made it a point to stop by and say hi or to ask if I needed any help. Some even invited me to grab lunch or coffee.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Keep an open mind and soak it all in.</strong> Going into my internship, <em>I didn&rsquo;t expect</em> to be working directly under a Distinguished Architect, a.k.a. Really Important Person. Not only that, I was given the opportunity to work on a brand new project. So, almost all the code will be written by me. Talk about a valuable experience! Intimidating too. Nonetheless, my manager had been supportive throughout and patient with my noobiness. Besides programming experience, being with a person of high caliber like my manager has given me an inside look of what it is like to manage not only a small team but an entire organization. This was incredibly special to me.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Be the rockstar that you are.</strong> It&rsquo;s perfectly OK to be shameless. I am naturally hard on myself and rarely feel like I&rsquo;m qualified. <em>I didn&rsquo;t expect</em> to be given so much responsibility and trust on the project. It made me feel like I&rsquo;m another member of the team and not just an intern. My manager trusted me, so I should trust myself and in my abilities. Your mentors want you to succeed so don&rsquo;t be afraid to show what you got. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to make mistakes either!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Have some fun.</strong> Work hard, play hard. Fun is just as important when it comes to culture. Cerner holds a stigma of being a &ldquo;sweatshop&rdquo; due to a controversial email in the past. However, <em>I didn&rsquo;t expect</em> how much I&rsquo;d enjoy this internship. I understand why culture is such an important thing now, and why companies like Cerner and Google spend so much on developing a creative office space.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Favorite Memories</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Winning third place at the <a href="http://sharynneazhar.com/blog/2017/intern-hackfest/">Cerner Intern Hackfest</a> and having the opportunity to present in front of 50+ interns and other Cerner employees in the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/iQCarQH.jpg">Assembly</a>. It was one heck of a week with lots and lots of code and data mining. It was also one heck of a struggle balancing actual work with Hackfest work. Here are a couple pictures from the event:</li>

<ul>
<li><p>Learning <a href="https://twitter.com/CernerEng/status/872875787459973122">how to effectively use an office space to prank your team members</a> at DevCon. It was so amazing to see Cerner supporting good ol&rsquo; office pranks. It really showed me that Cerner cares about having a positive company culture.</p></li>

<li><p>Drinking an absurd amount of coffee. There are free coffee machines on every floor of the Cerner campus and it doesn&rsquo;t seem to ever run out of coffee. It&rsquo;s a dream come true.</p></li>

<li><p>Flynn&rsquo;s Arcade. Spending hours on end playing Galaga or Foosball. Some friends also came to visit one day and we spent a good hour finishing a round of Chinese Checkers. Also, shouts to the giant chess set on the 5th floor.</p></li>

<li><p>Cerner Interns 17 Discord. It&rsquo;s a love-hate relationship.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These past two months have been an awesome experience. Cerner is a giant in the healthcare IT space and has a pretty cool company culture ‚ùÑÔ∏è. My best takeaway? Throw away all expectations. Just be open, trust yourself, and have some fun. You&rsquo;ll be surprised of the rewards. I am beyond thankful and will definitely miss being around the office, but I&rsquo;m excited to see what the future holds.</p>

<p>Who knows, maybe I&rsquo;ll be back next year. Full-time. üòâ</p>
