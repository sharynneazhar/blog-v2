      <p>For a current project I&rsquo;m working on, I had the task to create a generic table view. There were a few caveats. The website will be used in schools so that means a lot of Internet Explorer users&hellip; possibly old versions of IE as well.</p>

<p>Well, that stinks.</p>

<p>My first instinct is to use Bootstrap&rsquo;s table component. Bootstrap already has responsive class all set up and ready to go, so why not? It turns out that Bootstrap&rsquo;s table doesn&rsquo;t work so well with mobile-size screens. I had expected the table to collapse, but Bootstrap&rsquo;s solution was to simply enable horizontal scrolling. üòê</p>

<p>So, I had to go on a Google quest.</p>

<p>The best solution I found was to &ldquo;force the table to not behave like a table&rdquo;. Say whaat?! The solution works by setting the table components to be block-level and making each of the table rows to be a table in itself. The key to the solution is the CSS <code>:before</code> pseudo-class.</p>

<p>Best part, it work with IE!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll admit that the solution isn&rsquo;t perfect, but it works for what I needed. Let me know if you&rsquo;ve found a better solution. I&rsquo;d love to learn about it. üòä</p>
