      <p>Hey peeps. This is the start of my coding related blog! I‚Äôve been wanting to start this but never really found a good opportunity.</p>

<p>Until now! ü§ó</p>

<p>As part of my internship training, I was tasked to come up with a project idea and build it from scratch! Front-end to back-end. Ruby on Rails. I had a few different ideas but this one is the most relevant to my current hobbies. So, without further ado, I introduce you‚Ä¶</p>

<p>TopSetup‚Ñ¢ - Browse top setups from around the world or show off your own setup!</p>

<p>This idea came from a little winter break project to convert the office room into a gaming room. There weren‚Äôt very many dedicated websites out there for full gaming and work setups. Of course there are sites like <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/">PCPartPicker.com</a> and a bunch of different subreddits, but I wanted something more whole and cough pretty.</p>

<p>So, here‚Äôs to starting a this blog üçª and here‚Äôs to documenting my coding journey üçª. Check out the images below to witness the early designs of TopSetup‚Ñ¢!</p>
