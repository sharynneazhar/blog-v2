As a developer, the only thing I’ve ever considered when it comes to user experience is performance. Is my app laggy? Is my website slow? My worries usually end there.

But, UX design is so much more than that. There are certain [rules of thumb][1] I never thought I’d have to think about. For example, did you know labels should be placed **ABOVE** a form field? You don’t want your users to move their eyes too much. Also, did you know you should give the option to redo or undo when possible? Because, you know, people like to be in control. 😝

It was fun, though. This exercise really forced me to think about how each and every component on this website will interact to make my users really enjoy the experience. That was, in fact, how I came up with this website idea. I wanted to create something that reflects the whole aesthetic of a top notch 👌🏻 gaming setup. Most websites out there showcasing these setups don’t do that.

Here’s a sneak peek of what I came up with 🎥
